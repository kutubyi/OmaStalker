This project automates reservation monitoring for high-demand restaurants (e.g., Sugitaâ€”the mythical sushi spot that never has openings, doesnâ€™t send notifications for canceled slots, and haunts my dreams. I built this in the hope that I might actually get to try it before I die ðŸ˜¢) on [omakase.in](https://omakase.in).  

It checks availability at preset intervals and sends an email notification when a reservation becomes available.
